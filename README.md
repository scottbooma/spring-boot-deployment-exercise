# Spring Boot Deployment Practice

Check out the deployed app in all of its glory [here](https://spring-boot-test-deployment.herokuapp.com/api/dogs).

Deploy the included working Spring Boot app to a cloud provider. Some things to note:

- The app will need a database to attach to
- The app needs to use environment variables but currently does not
- The app is based on Java 11

If it works, it will respond to requests at `api/dogs` without erroring.
